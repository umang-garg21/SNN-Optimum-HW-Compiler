A new verison of Spiking neural network compliler that incorporates 
processing-in-memory tiles architecture in loop to optimize for accuracy, 
maximum resource (NoC Bandwidth, crossbar) utilization and compliation time. 

Includes Technniques like: Synchronous data-flow graphs, token-firings, KL graph partitioning,
Particle Swarm Optimization, Tabu Search, Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search for best map search. 
Integrated with run-time mapping including greedy search for least compilation time.

Frameworks used: PyCARL, Noxim++, CARLSim
