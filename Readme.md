A new verison of Spiking neural network compliler that incorporates 
processing-in-memory tiles architecture in loop to optimize for accuracy, 
maximum resource (NoC Bandwidth, crossbar) utilization and compliation time 
among others (congestion, latency, throughput etc.)

Includes Technniques like: Synchronous data-flow graphs, token-firings, KL graph partitioning, 
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Simulated Annealing (SA), Tabu Search (TS) for best map search. 
Integrated with run-time mapping including greedy search for least compilation time.

A best heterogenous core-architecture exploration to be employed during static evaluation for best offline mapping.

An exploration front for technqiues like Block circulant matrices and systolic dataflow, pipelining.

Frameworks being used: PyCARL, Noxim++, CARLSim, Machine Learning, SNN2SDF, ANN to SNN Converter
